         <h2>Commentary</h2>  
         <p>It is clear from the contents of the text that this plate was meant to be the second
            plate in a set. The fact that the backside of the plate is not used is peculiar and
            raises the suspicion that either the charter has never been finished, or the engraver
            deviated from the standard and used more plates.</p>  
         <p>Sircar <a href="http://zotero.org/groups/1633743/items/YXI7TJ4R">1965</a>: 347–348: <a href="http://zotero.org/groups/1633743/items/X8WYJVBX">1974</a>: 265: has argued that the epithet <span class="lang" lang="eng"><i>paramagurudevatādhidaivataviśeṣaḥ</i></span> in the introduction should be emended to <span class="lang" lang="eng"><i>paramagurudaivatādhidaivataviśeṣaḥ</i></span>, as an elaboration of <span class="lang" lang="eng"><i>paramadaivata</i></span>. He translates the compound with "one who is a great teacher (of his subjects) and
            devotee of the gods and the supreme god" . It seems unlikely that the word <span class="lang" lang="eng"><i>adhidaivata</i></span> refers to the king’s devotion to "the supreme god" , however, because that devotion
            is already expressed in the epithet <span class="lang" lang="eng"><i>paramamāheśvara</i></span>. The interpretation of the compound as translated here is provided by Yuko Yokochi,
